# Task Manager 

Task Manager is a task management system similar to http://www.redmine.org/. It allows you to set tasks, assign performers and change their statuses. Registration and authentication are required to work with the system.
Much attention in this project is paid to creating entities using ORM and describing the relationships between them (o2m, m2m).
For a greater level of automation, the project uses resource routing, which allows you to unify and simplify the work with typical CRUD operations. This is how a correct view is developed on the formation of urls and their connection with each other.

## Setup
